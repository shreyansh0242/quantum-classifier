          Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. 
          It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye(retina).

          If you have diabetes, see your eye doctor for a yearly eye exam with dilation â€” even if your vision seems fine.
          Developing diabetes when pregnant (gestational diabetes) or having diabetes before becoming pregnant can increase your risk of diabetic retinopathy. 
          If you're pregnant, your eye doctor might recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy.
          Contact your eye doctor right away if your vision changes suddenly or becomes blurry, spotty or hazy.

          In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. 
          These new blood vessels are fragile and can leak into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous).
          Eventually, scar tissue from the growth of new blood vessels can cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye. 
          If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure can build in the eyeball. 
          This buildup can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.
